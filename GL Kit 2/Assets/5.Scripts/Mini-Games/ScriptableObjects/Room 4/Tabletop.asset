  description: "Tabletop games are quite literally games you play on a tabletop. When
    talking about tabletop games most of the time we speak of card games, boardgames
    and dice games. The games are played physically and therefore require physical
    objects to be played. Tabletop games usually require multiple people to play.\r"

  name: Virtual Reality
  description: "Virtual Reality is a medium that typically is defined in terms of
    hardware. When we talk about Virtual Reality games we talk about games that are
    played with a headset / goggles that the user wears. By wearing it the player
    will find themselves in a virtual world (game) where they can walk around. Over
    the years more hardware compartments have been added, like for example controllers
    that simulate the player\u2019s hands in the video game with which they can directly
    interact with the virtual world, like with NPC\u2019s or objects.\r"

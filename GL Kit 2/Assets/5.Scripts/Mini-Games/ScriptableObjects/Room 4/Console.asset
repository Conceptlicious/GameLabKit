  description: 'Consoles are a medium that describes standalone systems that can run
    games without having to be connected to anything else. Consoles usually have their
    own specific set of buttons (on the controllers) with which the player can play
    the designated games. Currently the newest and most popular consoles are the Nintendo
    Switch, the Playstation 4 and the XBOX One. There are systems that are portable,
    but over the years these have proven themselves to be less popular in the west. '

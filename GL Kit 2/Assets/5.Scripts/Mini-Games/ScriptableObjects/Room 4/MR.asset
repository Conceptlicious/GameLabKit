  name: Mixed Reality
  description: Mixed reality describes a medium in which reality gets mixed with the
    digital world. For example, this can be done by placing digital objects into reality
    and have this viewable through Augmented Reality, or where Leap Motion is being
    used physically to control systems or games digitally. Interaction is the focus
    point of this medium.

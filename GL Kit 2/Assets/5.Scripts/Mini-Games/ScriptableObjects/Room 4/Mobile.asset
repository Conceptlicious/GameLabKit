  description: Mobile games are games that are played on smartphones. Mobile games
    are apps with gaming elements and are controlled with the touch screen. The fact
    that the only way to control mobile games with a touch screen makes understanding
    the controls a relatively quick process, if designed well. The play style of the
    games on this medium is very flexible and it can be left and picked up at any
    moment.
